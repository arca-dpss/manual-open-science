The aim of the present book is to describe programming good practices
and introduce common tools used in software development to guarantee
reproducibility of the analysis results. We want to make scientific
research an open-source knowledge development.

The book is available at
<https://arca-dpss.github.io/manual-open-science/>.

## Book Structure

The book is structured as follow.

-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we present th eaim of the book.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we introduce the Open Science
    Framework (OSF), a free, open source web application that allows
    researchers to collaborate, document, archive, share, and register
    research projects, materials, and data.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we describe recommended practices to
    organize all the materials and files of our projects and which are
    the advantages of creating a well structured, documented, and
    licensed repository.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we discuss main guidelines regarding
    organizing, documenting, and sharing data.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we provide general good practices to
    create readable and maintainable code and we describe the functional
    style approach.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we introduce version control, a
    powerful system for managing the development of our project. In
    particular, first we provide a basic tutorial about the use of the
    terminal. Next, we introduce Git and GitHub for managing and
    tracking our projects during the development.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we discuss how to manage the analysis
    workflow to enhance results reproducibility and code
    maintainability.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we introduce the main tools to create
    dynamic documents that integrate narrative text and code describing
    the advantages.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we discuss how to manage our project
    requirements and dependencies (software and package versions) to
    enhance results reproducibility.
-   In Chapter \[TODO: add ref\], we introduce Docker and the container
    technology that allow us creating and sharing an isolated,
    controlled, standardized environment for our project.

## About the Authors

During our careers, we both move towards Data Science after our PhD
Psychological Sciences. This book is our attempt to bring back into
scientific research what we have learned about outside academia.

-   [Claudio Zandonella
    Callegher](https://claudiozandonella.netlify.app/). During my PhD, I
    fell in love with data science. Understanding the complex phenomena
    that affect our lives by exploring data, formulating hypotheses,
    building models, and validating them. I find this whole process
    extremely challenging and motivating. Moreover, I am excited about
    new tools and solution to enhance replicability and transparency of
    scientific results.

## ARCA

<img style = "margin-left: 20px;" align="right" width="150" height="150" src="assets/images/arca-logo.png">

ARCA courses are advanced and highly applicable courses on modern tools
for research in Psychology. They are organised by the Department of
Developmental and Social Psychology at the University of Padua. At the
link dpss.unipd.it/arca it is possible to have detailed information on
all active courses.

## Acknowledgements

This book was inspired by Richard McElreath’s talk *“Science as Amateur
Software Development”* <https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY>. Talk abstract:

> Science is one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Academia, on the
> other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been,
> given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other
> fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science as a
> profession is largely *unprofessional* - apprentice scientists are
> taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn
> promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software
> development has become indispensable to scientific work. I want to
> playfully ask how it can become even more useful by transferring some
> aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and
> back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed,
> open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be
> distributed, open-source knowledge development.
