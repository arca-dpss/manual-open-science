The present book aims to describe programming good practices and
introduce common tools used in software development to guarantee the
reproducibility of the analysis results. We want to make scientific
research open-source knowledge development.

The book is available online at
<https://arca-dpss.github.io/manual-open-science/>.

A PDF copy is available at

## Book Content

In the book, we will learn to:

-   Share our materials using the Open Science Framework (**OSF**)
-   Learn how appropriately to structure and organize our matserials in
    a **repository**
-   Follow recommendations about data organization and data sharing
-   Improve code readability and maintainability using a **Functional
    Style**
-   Learn version control and collaboration using **Git** and **Github**
-   Manage analysis workflow with dedicated tools
-   Create dynamic documents
-   Manage project requirements and dependencies using dedicated tools
-   Create a container to guarantee reproducibility using **Docker**

This book provides useful recommendations and guidelines that can be
applied independently of the specific programming language. However,
examples and specific applications are based on the R programming
language. Readers working with programming languages other than R can
still find valuable guidelines and information and can later apply the
same workflow and ideas using dedicated tools specific to their
preferred programming language.

Finally, as most researchers have no formal training in programming and
software development, we provide a very gentle introduction to many
programming concepts and tools without assuming any previous knowledge.
Note, however, that we assume that the reader is already familiar with
the R programming language for specific examples and applications.

## About the Authors

During our careers, we both moved into the field of Data Science after
our PhD in Psychological Sciences. This book is our attempt to bring
back into scientific research what we have learned outside of academia.

-   [Claudio Zandonella
    Callegher](https://claudiozandonella.netlify.app/). During my PhD, I
    fell in love with data science. Understanding the complex phenomena
    that affect our lives by exploring data, formulating hypotheses,
    building models, and validating them. I find this whole process
    extremely challenging and motivating. Moreover, I am excited about
    new tools and solutions to enhance the replicability and
    transparency of scientific results.

ARCA courses are advanced and highly applicable courses on modern tools
for research in Psychology. They are organised by the Department of
Developmental and Social Psychology at the University of Padua.

## Acknowledgements

This book was inspired by Richard McElreath’s talk *“Science as Amateur
Software Development”* <https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY>. Talk abstract:

> Science is one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Academia, on the
> other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been,
> given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other
> fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science as a
> profession is largely *unprofessional* - apprentice scientists are
> taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn
> promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software
> development has become indispensable to scientific work. I want to
> playfully ask how it can become even more useful by transferring some
> aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and
> back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed,
> open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be
> distributed, open-source knowledge development.
