<blockquote>
<p>Science is one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Academia, on the other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science as a profession is largely <em>unprofessional</em> - apprentice scientists are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software development has become indispensable to scientific work. I want to playfully ask how it can become even more useful by transferring some aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed, open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be distributed, open-source knowledge development.</p>
<p>Richard McElreath’s “Science as Amateur Software Development” talk</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY" class="uri">https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard McElreath’s words are as enlightening as always. Usually, researchers start their academic careers led by their great interest in a specific scientific area. They want to answer some specific research question, but these questions quickly turn into data, statistical analysis, and lines of code, hundreds of lines of code. Most researchers, however, receive essentially no training about programming and software development good practices resulting in very chaotic habits that can lead to costly errors. Moreover, bad practices may hinder the transparency and reproducibility of the analysis results.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Open Science movement, transparency and reproducibility are recognized as fundamental requirements of modern scientific research. In fact, openly sharing study materials and analyses code are prerequisites for allowing results replicability by new studies. Note the difference between replicability and reproducibility <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nosekWhatReplication2020" role="doc-biblioref">Nosek &amp; Errington, 2020</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>, obtaining the results reported in the original study using the <em>same data</em> and the <em>same analysis</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Replicability</strong>, obtaining the results reported in the original study using <em>new data</em> but the <em>same analysis</em> (a new study with the same experimental design).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, reproducibility simply means re-running someone else’s code on the same data to obtain the same result. At first, this may seem a very simple task, but actually, it requires properly organising and managing all the analysis material. Without adequate programming and software development skills, it is very difficult to guarantee the reproducibility of the analysis results.</p>
<p>The aim of the present book is to describe programming good practices and introduce common tools used in software development to guarantee reproducibility of the analysis results. Inspired by Richard McElreath’s talk, we want to make scientific research an open-source knowledge development.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Book Structure<a href="introduction.html#book-structure" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The book is structured as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we introduce the Open Science Framework (OSF), a free, open-source web application that allows researchers to collaborate, document, archive, share, and register research projects, materials, and data.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we describe recommended practices to organize all the materials and files of our projects and which are the advantages of creating a well structured, documented, and licensed repository.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we discuss the main guidelines regarding organizing, documenting, and sharing data.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we provide general good practices to create readable and maintainable code and we describe the functional style approach.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we introduce version control, a powerful system for managing the development of our project. In particular, first, we provide a basic tutorial about the use of the terminal. Next, we introduce Git and GitHub for managing and tracking our projects during the development.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we discuss how to manage the analysis workflow to enhance results reproducibility and code maintainability.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we introduce the main tools to create dynamic documents that integrate narrative text and code describing the advantages.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we discuss how to manage our project requirements and dependencies (software and package versions) to enhance results reproducibility.</li>
<li>In Chapter [TODO: add ref], we introduce Docker and the container technology that allows us to create and share an isolated, controlled, standardized environment for our project.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Instructions<a href="introduction.html#instructions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s discuss some useful tips about how to get the best out of this book.</p>
<div id="programming-language" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Programming Language<a href="introduction.html#programming-language" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This book provides useful recommendations and guidelines that can be applied independently of the specific programming language used. However, examples and specific applications are based on the R programming languages.</p>
<p>In particular, each chapter first provides general recommendations and guidelines that apply to most programming languages. Subsequently, we discuss specific tools and applications available in R.</p>
<p>In this way, readers working with programming languages other than R can still find valuable guidelines and information and can later apply the same workflow and ideas using dedicated tools specific to their preferred programming language.</p>
</div>
<div id="long-journey" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Long Journey<a href="introduction.html#long-journey" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>To guarantee results replicability and project maintainability, we need to follow all the guidelines and apply all the tools covered in this book. However, if we are not already familiar with all these arguments, it could be incredibly overwhelming at first.</p>
<p>Do not try to apply all guidelines and tools all at once. Our recommendation is to build our reproducible workflow gradually, introducing new guidelines and new tools step by step at any new project. In this way, we have the time to learn and familiarize ourselves with a specific part of the workflow before introducing a new step.</p>
<p>The book is structured to facilitate this process, as each chapter is an independent step to build our reproducible workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our materials using online repositories services</li>
<li>Learn how to structure and organize our materials in a repository</li>
<li>Follow recommendations about data organization and data sharing</li>
<li>Improve code readability and maintainability using a Functional Style</li>
<li>Learn version control and collaboration using Git and Github</li>
<li>Manage analysis workflow with dedicated tools</li>
<li>Create dynamic documents</li>
<li>Manage project requirements and dependencies using dedicated tools</li>
<li>Create a container to guarantee reproducibility using Docker</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning advanced tools such as Git, pipeline tools, and Docker still requires a lot of time and practice. They may even seem excessive complex at first. However, we should consider them as an investment. As soon as our analyses will become more complex than a few lines e of code, these tools will allow us to safely develop and manage our project.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-programmer-friendly" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Non-Programmer Friendly<a href="introduction.html#non-programmer-friendly" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Most of the arguments discussed in this book are the A-B-C of the daily workflow of many programmers. The problem is that most researchers lack any kind of formal training in programming and software development.</p>
<p>The aim of the book is exactly that: to introduce popular tools and common guidelines of software development into scientific research. We try to provide a very gentle introduction to many programming concepts and tools without assuming any previous knowledge. Note, however, that we assume the reader is already familiar with the R programming language for specific examples and applications.</p>
<!-- # Notes -->
<!-- In recent years, there has been much debate about the replicability crisis of scientific findings. This methodological crisis has undetermined the credibility of many scientific fields. If you have been working in academic research recently, I am sure you are already familiar with all these issues. -->
<!-- Fortunately, however, one of the greatest strengths of scientific research is its ability to correct itself. In this perspective, the replicability crisis has become a great opportunity to revise, improve, and innovate our research practice and, certainly, the Open Science movement has become the main answer to this methodological crisis. -->
<!-- the open science movement aims to make scientific research transparent and accessible to everyone. This includes not only open access to the scientific paper but also openly sharing data and research materials -->
<!-- access and communicate -->
<!-- failure to reproduce scientific results undermining the credibility of many scientific fields. If you have been working in academic research, I am sure you have already heard a lot about the replicability crisis. -->
<!-- The Open Science movement is changing modern scientific research. -->
<!-- Open Science is not only the publishing industry's new commercial breakthrough -->
<!-- cumulating articles and citation is what moves your career but cumulating data is what moves science -->
