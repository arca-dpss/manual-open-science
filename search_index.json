About the Authors During our careers, we both moved into the field of Data Science after a PhD in Psychological Sciences. This book is our attempt to bring back into scientific research what we have learned outside of academia. Claudio Zandonella Callegher (claudiozandonella@gmail.com). During my PhD, I fell in love with data science. Understanding the complex phenomena that affect our lives by exploring data, formulating hypotheses, building models, and validating them. I find this whole process extremely challenging and motivating. Moreover, I am excited about new tools and solutions to enhance the replicability and transparency of scientific results. Davide Massidda (d.massidda@kode-solutions.net). ARCA ARCA courses are advanced and highly applicable courses on modern tools for research in Psychology. They are organised by the Department of Developmental and Social Psychology at the University of Padua.

Science, after all, aspires to be distributed, open-source knowledge development. “Science as Amateur Software Development” Richard McElreath (2020) https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY McElreath’s words are as enlightening as always. Usually, researchers start their academic careers led by their great interest in a specific scientific area. They want to answer some specific research question, but these questions quickly turn into data, statistical analysis, and lines of code, hundreds of lines of code. Most researchers, however, receive essentially no training about programming and software development good practices resulting in very chaotic habits that can lead to costly errors. Moreover, bad practices may hinder the transparency and reproducibility of the analysis results. Thanks to the Open Science movement, transparency and reproducibility are recognized as fundamental requirements of modern scientific research. In fact, openly sharing study materials and analyses code are prerequisites for allowing results replicability by new studies. Note the difference between replicability and reproducibility (Nosek &amp; Errington, 2020): Reproducibility, obtaining the results reported in the original study using the same data and the same analysis. Replicability, obtaining the results reported in the original study using new data but the same analysis (a new study with the same experimental design). So, reproducibility simply means re-running someone else’s code on the same data to obtain the same result. At first, this may seem a very simple task, but actually, it requires properly organising and managing all the analysis material. Without adequate programming and software development skills, it is very difficult to guarantee the reproducibility of the analysis results. The present book aims to describe programming good practices and introduce common tools used in software development to guarantee the reproducibility of analysis results. Inspired by Richard McElreath’s talk, we want to make scientific research an open-source knowledge development. 1.1 Book Structure The book is structured as follows. In Chapter ??, we introduce the Open Science Framework (OSF), a free, open-source web application that allows researchers to collaborate, document, archive, share, and register research projects, materials, and data. In Chapter ??, we describe recommended practices to organize all the materials and files of our projects and which are the advantages of creating a well structured, documented, and licensed repository. In Chapter ??, we discuss the main guidelines regarding organizing, documenting, and sharing data. In Chapter ??, we provide general good practices to create readable and maintainable code and we describe the functional style approach. In Chapter ??, we provide a basic tutorial about the use of the terminal. In Chapter ??, we introduce Git software for tracking changes in any file during the development of our project. In Chapter ??, we introduce GitHub for managing collaboration using remote repositories. In Chapter ??, we discuss how to manage the analysis workflow to enhance results reproducibility and code maintainability. In Chapter ??, we introduce the main tools to create dynamic documents that integrate narrative text and code describing the advantages. In Chapter ??, we discuss how to manage our project requirements and dependencies (software and package versions) to enhance results reproducibility. In Chapter ??, we introduce Docker and the container technology that allows us to create and share an isolated, controlled, standardized environment for our project. In Chapter ??, we introduce the Rocker Project which provides Docker Containers for the R Environment. 1.2 Instructions Let’s discuss some useful tips about how to get the best out of this book. 1.2.1 Programming Language This book provides useful recommendations and guidelines that can be applied independently of the specific programming language used. However, examples and specific applications are based on the R programming languages. In particular, each chapter first provides general recommendations and guidelines that apply to most programming languages. Subsequently, we discuss specific tools and applications available in R. In this way, readers working with programming languages other than R can still find valuable guidelines and information and can later apply the same workflow and ideas using dedicated tools specific to their preferred programming language. 1.2.2 Long Journey To guarantee results replicability and project maintainability, we need to follow all the guidelines and apply all the tools covered in this book. However, if we are not already familiar with all these arguments, it could be incredibly overwhelming at first. Do not try to apply all guidelines and tools all at once. Our recommendation is to build our reproducible workflow gradually, introducing new guidelines and new tools step by step at any new project. In this way, we have the time to learn and familiarize ourselves with a specific part of the workflow before introducing a new step. The book is structured to facilitate this process, as each chapter is an independent step to build our reproducible workflow: Share our materials using online repositories services Learn how to structure and organize our materials in a repository Follow recommendations about data organization and data sharing Improve code readability and maintainability using a Functional Style Learn version control and collaboration using Git and Github Manage analysis workflow with dedicated tools Create dynamic documents Manage project requirements and dependencies using dedicated tools Create a container to guarantee reproducibility using Docker Learning advanced tools such as Git, pipeline tools, and Docker still requires a lot of time and practice. They may even seem excessively complex at first. However, we should consider them as an investment. As soon as our analyses will become more complex than a few lines e of code, these tools will allow us to safely develop and manage our project. 1.2.3 Non-Programmer Friendly Most of the arguments discussed in this book are the A-B-C of the daily workflow of many programmers. The problem is that most researchers lack any kind of formal training in programming and software development. The aim of the book is exactly that: to introduce popular tools and common guidelines of software development into scientific research. We try to provide a very gentle introduction to many programming concepts and tools without assuming any previous knowledge. Note, however, that we assume the reader is already familiar with the R programming language for specific examples and applications. 1.2.4 Info Boxes Inside the book, there are special Info-Boxes that provide further details. Tip-Boxes are used to provide insight into specific topics. Warning-Boxes are used to provide important warnings. Instructions-Boxes are used to provide detailed instructions. Details-Boxes are used to provide further details about advanced topics. Trick-Boxes are used to describe special useful tricks. Command Cheatsheets are used to summarize commands of a specific software. Moreover, at the end of each chapter, we list all useful links to external documentation in a dedicated box. Documentation-Boxes are used to collect all useful links to external documentation. References Nosek, B. A., &amp; Errington, T. M. (2020). What is replication?
